Installation
************

All EWST functionality is based on Matlab code, as such installion requires
only that the code is present on the 

`Matlab path <https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_env/what-is-the-matlab-search-path.html>`_

. However, it should be noted that EWST is dependant on the MBDyn Matlab-based 
preprocessor, which has it's own installation instructions and requirements.
It is most likely you will have recived both EWST and the reuuired MBDyn tools 
as a single package. These two packages, while standalone, are closely related
an developed in tandem.
