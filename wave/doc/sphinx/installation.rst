Installation
************

All EWST functionality is based on Matlab code, as such installation requires
only that the code is present on the `Matlab path`_. However, it should be
noted that EWST is dependant on the MBDyn Matlab preprocessor, which has
its own installation instructions and requirements. It is most likely you will
have received both EWST and the required MBDyn tools as a single package. These
two packages, while standalone, are closely related and developed in tandem.
