Installation
************

All |TNShort| functionality is based on Matlab code, as such installation 
requires only that the code is present on the `Matlab path`_. 
However, it should be noted that |TNShort| is dependant on the MBDyn 
Matlab preprocessor, which has its own installation instructions and 
requirements. It is most likely you will have received both EWST and 
the required MBDyn tools as a single package. These two packages, 
while standalone, are closely related and developed in tandem.

RenewNet Foundry
================

You may also have received |TNShort| as part of the RenewNet Foundry 
package, in this case you should first refer to the README file in 
the top level of the RenewNet Foundry package and follow the 
instructions there. The RenewNet Foundry installation is automated 
through the `rnfoundry_setup.m` function, and |TNShort| is installed 
automatically by this.
