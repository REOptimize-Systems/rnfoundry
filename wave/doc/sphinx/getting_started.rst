Getting Started
***************

As sated previously, |TNshort| is is based in Matlab code [#f1]_, which can also run in Octave.
|TNshort| requires the free MBDyn multibody modelling package to describe and simulate the
motion of the system.






.. [#f1] The |TNshort| functions are in pure Matlab, but the MBDyn package uses a function written in C++ to communicate with the MBDyn multibody modelling program.
