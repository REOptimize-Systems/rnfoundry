Getting Started
***************

As sated previously, EWST is is based in Matlab code [#f1]_, which can also run in Octave. 
EWST requires the free MBDyn multibody modelling package to describe and simulate the 
motion of the system. 






.. [#f1] The EWST functions are in pure Matlab, but the MBDyn package uses a function written in C++ to communicate with the MBDyn multibody modelling program.
