NEMOH
*****

The time domain simulator requires that you supply frequency domain
hydrodynamic coefficients derived from potential flow analysis. One
program capable of generating the required data is `NEMOH`_. NEMOH
is a Boundary Element Methods (BEM) code dedicated to the computation
of first order wave loads on offshore structures (added mass,
radiation damping, diffraction forces). It has been developed by
researchers at Ecole Centrale de Nantes for 30 years and was recently
released under a free software licence (`Apache v2`_)
