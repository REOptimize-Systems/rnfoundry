Here follows a summary of the contents of the buoy data files. In
general these files contain data at multiple frequencies. However,
the frequencies are specified as wave numbers. To convert from 
wave number to angular frequency divide 

************    .2    Excitation Files       *************

The .2 file, usually named excitation_force_*.2, where * is replaced
by some text contains the excitation forces at a number of frequencies,
or rather different wave numbers, which is what is provided in the file.

The excitation file contains the nondimensional excitation forces on 
the buoy at each frequency.

The excitation force of the body has been made dimensionless by
dividing by the buoyancy force required to submerge the body one
metre and the mass of the body, respectively. This has been done for
ease of comparison between model scales. An example is presented
in Bailey Thesis pg 30 Figure 2.4. 

Column 3 tells you whether the line is for heave or surge. If this 
contains 3 it is heave, if 1 it is surge. In each case then column
6 contains the real excitation and column 7 the imaginary excitation
forces. Column 1 is the wave number (k).

To scale these to a given wave you must multiply by rho * g * A, where
rho and g are the density and gravitational acceleration and A the 
wave amplitude.


************    .1   Hydro Coefficients      ***************  

The .1 file, usually named hydro_coefficients_*.2, where * is replaced 
by some text contains the added mass values for the buoy in heave and 
surge at various frequncies (or rather wave numbers).

If columns 2 and 3 both contain the value '3', the line contains the 
added mass information for the buoy in heave in column 4, and the 
wave number in column 1.

If columns 2 and 3 both contain the value '3', the line contains the 
added mass information for the buoy in surge in column 4, and the 
wave number in column 1.


***********    .mat  Heave Radiation         ****************

The heave_radiation_*.mat file contains the 'alpha' and 'beta' 
radiation coefficients for the buoy in heave. These are the 'alpha's 
and 'beta's used in Prony's method as approximations to the 
radiation forces convolution. There is normally around 20 values,
although there can be more or less. The number of these that you
use determines the accuracy of the approximation. These are not 
related to the frequency/wave number.

***********    .mat  Surge Radiation         ****************

The surge_radiation_*.mat file contains the 'alpha' and 'beta' 
radiation coefficients for the buoy in surge. These are the 'alpha's 
and 'beta's used in Prony's method as approximations to the 
radiation forces convolution. There is normally around 20 values,
although there can be more or less. The number of these that you
use determines the accuracy of the approximation. These are not 
related to the frequency/wave number.

***********    .mat  Buoy Parameters         ****************

The buoy_parameters_*.mat file contains a numer of variables specifying
various aspecs of the buoy. The follwing variables should be present:

a: radius of the buoy

amp: 

draft: draft of the buoy at rest

drag_coefficient: drag coefficient (just taken from lierature, do not
                  place great faith in this)

freq: resonant frequency in Hz

g: acceleration due to gravity 

mass_external: mass displaced by the buoy

maxfreq: max frequency in Hz the hydro data is provided to

minfreq: min frequency in Hz the hydro data is provided to

phase:

resfreq: resonant frequency in Hz

rho: water density

sigma: resonant freq in rad/s

water_depth: water depth the buoy data was generated for
