This folder contains basic utilities, and generic tools, such
as mathmatical functions, curve fitting tools, file system tools 
and many more.

As elsewhere directories starting 'tb' are packaged toolboxes, 
and other directories are collections of discrete functions, but
grouped according their general purpose.

A significant number of these functions have been obtained from 
the Matlab file exchange, and are provided here for convenience 
only. In some cases these functions have been modified for the 
specific needs of other functions in the Renew-Net Foundry. The
Foundry authors express their thanks to the authors of these tools
for sharing them. We clearly retain any attribution to the 
authors in the files but below is a list of the contributers of 
those files from the file exchange, in no particular order:

John D'Errico
