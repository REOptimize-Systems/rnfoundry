Common Electrical Base Components


This directory hold Qucs circuit simulator schematics and netlists 
for generic base components such as transformers, transmission lines,
electrical machines and power electronics components. These circuits 
should be subcircuits, parameterised to allow easy conversion into 
a specific device model.
