Common Electrical Specific Components


This directory hold Qucs circuit simulator schematics and netlists 
for specific examples of components such as transformers, transmission 
lines, electrical machines and power electronics components. These circuits
are generally derived from the base components of the same type, but with 
specific parameters applied.
